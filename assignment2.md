1. Firstly, we both modified the style.css file, we both staged and committed
our file, Krum then pushed his modifications, and I tried to do same, 
which resulted in an error. I had to pull his version, which lead to our file
having conflict-resolution markers, which I erased. I then staged, commmitted
and pushed the file with both of our modifications and then Krum pulled it.

2.Yes, there was a conflict. I was unable to push my version of the repository
after Krum had, without pulling first. The style.css had conflict-resolution
markers which indicated both of our changes.

3. The first step was to pull the file with Krums changes. I then deleted
the conflict-resolution markers in the file. The file now had "border-radius
:25px;" and "border: 1px solid rgb(80,112,158);". I then staged, committed 
and pushed the changes. Krum pulled afterwards.

4. 

	a) To fix the issue made on GitHub, I modified the style.css file, 
and then staged and committed it. When commiting the file I added a message
that had "#2" in the message, this lets git know that the commit is connected
to the issue number 2. When Krum committed his changes, he added "fixes #1"
which automatically closes the issue number 1 after committing.

	b)No there was not a conflict when merging. This is only because after
I had fixed my issue. I staged, committed and pushed my version. Krum then 
pulled. After pulling, he then started fixing his issue. If we had both made
our changes at the same time then there would have been conflicts.

	c) We solved the conflict by realizing ahead of time there would be
one and taking measures to stop it. We performed our changes one after another
So when Krum was editing the style.css file, he had already pulled my changes.
