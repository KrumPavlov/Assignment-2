#Assignment 2
Names: Noah Groleau & Krum Pavlov

1. Firstly, we both modified the style.css file, we both staged and committed
our file, Krum then pushed his modifications, and I tried to do same, 
which resulted in an error. I had to pull his version, which lead to our file
having conflict-resolution markers, which I erased. I then staged, commmitted
and pushed the file with both of our modifications and then Krum pulled it.

2.Yes, there was a conflict. I was unable to push my version of the repository
after Krum had, without pulling first. The style.css had conflict-resolution
markers which indicated both of our changes.

3. The first step was to pull the file with Krums changes. I then deleted
the conflict-resolution markers in the file. The file now had "border-radius
:25px;" and "border: 1px solid rgb(80,112,158);". I then staged, committed 
and pushed the changes. Krum pulled afterwards.
